Some weeks ago I started working on a new open source software, called <a href="https://github.com/manuelkiessling/bivouac" title="GitHub page of bivouac"><em>bivouac</em></a>.

<a href="https://github.com/manuelkiessling/bivouac" title="GitHub page of bivouac">bivouac</a> provides an open source software package which allows to easily setup and run web-based group chats with dead-simple file-sharing (drag a file into the chat, and it’s immediately available as a download for all chat members).

bivouac is written in JavaScript, for the Node.js platform. It’s hosted at <a href="https://github.com/manuelkiessling/bivouac" title="GitHub page of bivouac">https://github.com/manuelkiessling/bivouac</a>
