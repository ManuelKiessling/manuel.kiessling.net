## The Anatomy of Peace – Second Edition

{{< figure src="/images/aop-cover2.jpg" width="100" class="floatright ml-5" >}}

What if in our conflicts with others there is something we want more than solutions? What if conflicts at home, conflicts at work, and conflicts in the world stem from the same root cause? And what if individually and collectively we systematically misunderstand that cause, and unwittingly perpetuate the very problems we think we are trying to solve? These are among the important questions explored in [The Anatomy of Peace](https://arbinger.com/product/the-anatomy-of-peace/).


## Showstopper!

{{< figure src="/images/519BOZ3WgzL._SX317_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="100" class="floatright ml-5" >}}

[Showstopper!](https://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Microsoft/dp/0029356717) is a vivid account of the creation of Microsoft Windows NT, perhaps the most complex software project ever undertaken. It is also a portrait of David Cutler, NT's brilliant and, at times, brutally aggressive chief architect.

Cutler surely ranks as one of the most impressive software engineers the field has ever produced. After leading the team that created the VMS operating system for Digital's VAX computer line--an accomplishment that most would regard as a lifetime achievement--he went on to conceive and lead the grueling multi-year project that ultimately produced Windows NT. Both admired and feared by his team, Cutler would let nothing stand in the way of realizing his design and often clashed with his programmers, senior Microsoft management, and even Gates himself.


## The Practicing Mind

{{< figure src="/images/418ln0JJLqL._SX311_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="100" class="floatright ml-5" >}}

Early life is all about trial-and-error practice. If we had given up in the face of failure, repetition, and difficulty, we would never have learned to walk or tie our shoes. So why, as adults, do we often give up on a goal when at first we don’t succeed? In his study of how we learn (prompted by his pursuit of disciplines such as music and golf), Sterner has found that we have forgotten the principles of practice — the process of picking a goal and applying steady effort to reach it. The methods Sterner teaches in [The Practicing Mind](https://thepracticingmind.com/buy-the-book/) show that practice done properly isn’t drudgery on the way to mastery but a fulfilling process in and of itself, one that builds discipline and clarity.


## The Making of the Atomic Bomb

Twenty-five years after its initial publication, [The Making of the Atomic Bomb](http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Making-of-the-Atomic-Bomb/Richard-Rhodes/9781451677614) remains the definitive history of nuclear weapons and the Manhattan Project. From the turn-of-the-century discovery of nuclear energy to the dropping of the first bombs on Japan, Richard Rhodes’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book details the science, the people, and the socio-political realities that led to the development of the atomic bomb.


## The Birth of the Modern: World Society 1815-1830

{{< figure src="/images/320349.jpeg" width="100" class="floatright ml-5" >}}

The extraordinary, bestselling chronicle of the period that laid the foundations of the modern world. From the bestselling author of Modern Times, A History of the Jews, and Intellectuals, a provocative, challenging, and readable history of 15 years that laid the foundations of the modern world. The period after Waterloo (1815-1830), traditionally viewed as an "Age of Reaction", was astonishly fertile in new ideas and, Johnson maintains, the modern world.



## Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

{{< figure src="/images/51zJS6PmxbL._SX333_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="100" class="floatright ml-5" >}}

Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with [this highly original book](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.
