The goal of *Develop, Build, Deploy - Repeat!* is to teach software developers and systems administrators how to build successful Continuous Delivery setups for software products - setups that are stable, maintainable, and adaptable.

To achieve this goal, this project will regularly release educational material in the form of blog posts, tutorials, books, and video courses.
