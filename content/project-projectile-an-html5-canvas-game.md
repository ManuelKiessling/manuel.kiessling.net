  Some days ago my son asked me how computer games are made. I couldn’t really explain it very well in terms he understood (he’s 5 years old), but I wanted to show it to him. Thus I started working with him on a 2D space shooter written in JavaScript, using the canvas element of HTML5. The result is playable at <em><a href="http://manuel.kiessling.net/projectile/">http://manuel.kiessling.net/projectile/</a></em>.
